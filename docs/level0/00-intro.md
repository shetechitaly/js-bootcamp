# Awesome Tasks

**A simple JavaScript app that will help you getting things done.**

This walk-through will guide you through the development of the app.

We will be introducing new concepts on each step so make sure you understand what's going on before going further! If you have any doubts, please ask your coach for help.

## Key concepts

During the workshop we will be covering the following concepts:

### JavaScript

* Base values: `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, undefined values
* Variables and functions
* Compound values: `Array` and `Object`
* Language Structure: `if`
* Array methods \(`forEach`, `filter`, `push`\)
* String methods \(`trim`, `replace`\)

### The DOM

* `Element` and some of its properties and methods \(`querySelector`, `innerHTML`, `previousElementSibling`, `dataset`\)
* The events and the event object main properties \(`target`, `preventDefault`\)

### Persistence on the browser

* `JSON` and `localStorage`

There are many new things to learn if this is your first programming experience, and we really hope you will enjoy it!
